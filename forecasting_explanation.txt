# Forecasting System Documentation

## Forecasting Overview

Our system includes a forecasting module that predicts future product demand based on historical sales data. The goal of the forecast is to help:

- Plan inventory more accurately  
- Reduce stockouts (running out of items)  
- Avoid overstocking, which ties up capital and storage space  

The forecast uses past sales patterns to estimate how much of each product will be needed in upcoming periods (e.g., days, weeks, or months).

## Data Used for Forecasting

The forecasting process typically uses:

- Historical sales quantities per product per time period  
- Time period (day/week/month)  
- Recent trends (whether sales are increasing or decreasing)  
- Seasonality (if applicable, e.g., higher demand on weekends or certain months)  

Only cleaned and valid sales records are included so that unusual or invalid entries do not distort the prediction.

## Forecasting Formula (Example: Moving Average)

A common method used is the Moving Average Forecast, where the forecast for the next period is the average of the sales from the last N periods.

Formula:

Let:
- Ft+1 = forecast for the next period  
- At = actual sales in the current period  
- At-1, At-2, ..., At-(N-1) = actual sales in previous periods  
- N = number of periods used in the average (window size)

Then:

Ft+1 = (At + At-1 + At-2 + ... + At-(N-1)) / N

This means we add the sales of the last N periods and divide by N to get the expected demand for the next period.

## Important Concepts

- Forecast Horizon  
  How far ahead we are forecasting (e.g., next day, next week, next month).

- Window Size (N)  
  How many past periods are included in the average.  
  - Small N → more responsive to recent changes but more "noisy"  
  - Large N → smoother but slower to react

- Trend and Seasonality  
  If sales are clearly increasing/decreasing or have seasonal peaks, the model can be adjusted (e.g., weighting recent periods more).

- Forecast Error  
  After actual sales occur, we compare them to the forecast to see how accurate it was.  
  Common metrics:  
  - Error = Actual – Forecast  
  - Absolute Error = |Actual – Forecast|  
  - These are used to tune N or improve the method.

## How the Forecast Is Used in the System

- Reorder Planning  
  The forecasted demand per product is compared to current stock and safety stock to determine when to reorder and how much.

- Stock Level Decisions  
  If the forecasted demand is higher than current stock, the system can flag items as "at risk of stockout".

- Reporting  
  Forecasts are shown alongside actual sales to help management monitor performance and adjust purchasing strategies.

## Implementation in Our System

The forecasting implementation in our POS and inventory management system:

1. Collects historical sales data from completed transactions
2. Calculates average demand per product over configurable time periods
3. Projects future demand based on the calculated averages
4. Integrates with the inventory management system to suggest reorder quantities
5. Updates in real-time as new sales are processed

This forecasting system helps maintain optimal stock levels across all products, ensuring we meet customer demand while minimizing excess inventory costs.
